# ðŸ“±Phone-Virus-Transmission-Simulation
GUI mobile phone virus transmission simulation in Java.

In this mobile phone virus transmission simulation, a virus begins its journey in a randomly selected phone and quickly spreads to others within a 20-pixel range. Once infected, a phone's only chance of survival is to make it to the repair shop, where it can be fixed. However, the repair shop can only handle one phone at a time, creating a critical race against the clock. If an infected phone isn't repaired within 500 frames, it will be removed from the simulation, simulating its "death." The simulation relies on a carefully designed "synchronized" algorithm to manage this urgent repair process, ensuring a dynamic and engaging experience as you observe the virus's relentless spread and the phones' struggle to survive.
